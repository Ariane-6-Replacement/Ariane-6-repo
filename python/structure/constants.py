'''
Various constants used in the structural sizing.
'''

FOSY = 1.4
FOSU = 1.7
FOS_ITS = 3.0 # seperate FoS for its to account for more discontinuitites due to riveting;
g_0 = 9.81 # m / s^2
Km= 1.2 #Mass factor, taken fron the Launch Vehicle Reader;
Ku = 1.05 #[-], ullage + boiled off propellant + trapped propellant + PMD extension factor for volume extension estiamted from Desing of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines by Huzel and Huang
Mi = 1.123 #[kg/m2], insulation mass estimation for LOx / Methane from MER sizing from University of Maryland presentaion 
Mthruststructure = 3500 #[kg] mass of thrust structure obtained through FEA
